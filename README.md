# Shakespearean Quote Generator

A Rails server that generates random quotes from Shakespeare plays! Built as part of my talk for RubyConf 2021.

## Setup

1. Fork and clone this repository
2. Run `bundle install` to install dependencies
3. Run `rails s` to start the server
4. Make a GET call to `localhost:3000/quote` to get a random Shakespeare quote!
